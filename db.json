            "en":"Ladies look out, here comes Poolboy Bruce. This powerful strain is made from dense buds resulting in a very THC content. Bruce believes life is all about balance and that's why he's here to bring you the perfect combination of Sativa and Indica effects. Fun facts about Bruce: he tastes of a pungent citrus but compared to his smell, tastes a little earthier (loves gardening) and less sweet (not too big of a sweet tooth on this guy). Now I know you're all thinking Wow Bruce sounds amazing! Where in the world did he come from. Well, bred by Jason Holck of Dark Horse Genetics, he was cross bred with Strawberry Diesel and OG Kush. Similar to other plants of this strain, it took Bruce 8 to 10 weeks to reach his full potential and let me tell you, he was a sight to behold. Rich magenta hued leaves, bright green buds frosted with large headed trichomes and red hairs. One look and you're thinking Damn, that dude is rad."
